# Gutenvisual

The aim of the project is to design and implement a user-friendly interface for,

- Searching books from Gutenberg project and collecting the chosen books in a visual bookshelf for a specific user of the system. 

- Every user should see his own bookshelf when logs in.

- He/she should be able to change the books in his/her own shelf by making new searches.

- He/she can simply remove one book from his shelf if the book is finished. 

- The system should also keep track of the page where the user paused reading.
